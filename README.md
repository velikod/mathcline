# Cline

A Python library for representing circles and lines in the complex plane using the general _cline_ equation.

The inspiration for this package comes from the open source book [Geometry with an Introduction to Cosmic Topology](https://mphitchman.com/geometry/preface.html) by Michael P. Hitchman, which is a fascinating introduction to non-Euclidean geometries following the Erlangen program. The approach in the book relies heavily on MÃ¶bius transformations and their effects on _clines_.

## Overview

A cline is a circle or line that can be represented by the equation:

```math
cz\bar{z} + \alpha z + \bar{\alpha}\bar{z} + d = 0
```

where:
- $c$ and $d$ are real numbers
- $\alpha$ is a complex number
- It's a circle if $|\alpha|^2 > c \cdot d$ and $c \neq 0$
- It's a line if $c = 0$
- It's a point if $|\alpha|^2 = c \cdot d$ and $c \neq 0$

This unified representation allows for elegant manipulation of both circles and lines in the complex plane.
